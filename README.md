Description
Implement linear algebra functions using linear comprehension:

vector shape in shape()
vector addition in vector_add()
vector subtraction in vector_sub()
vector sum in vector_sum()
dot product in dot()

Future Add Ons

Using test driven development, implement the same functionality as the Normal and Advanced Modes in Vector and Matrix classes with methods instead of functions
